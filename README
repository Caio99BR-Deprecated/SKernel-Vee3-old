SKernel

SKernel was created for giving the users of "underprivileged" devices a memorable experience. 
It ensures that everything is perfect from kernel side. 
SKernel was created in mind, keeping these things - Speed, Performance and Stability. 
None had an upper hand over the other, all were given equal importance. 
After all the bits were in their right places, SKernel was born.
Initially built for the LG Optimus L5, SKernel now supports all the variants of LG Optimus L5, L7 and L3 II.
